# Tokens-PHP

allows the simple creation and management of user-specific tokens in PHP
This project has been created as part of my [Day-to-Day project](https://www.github.com/jimmybear217/day-to-day)

## Usage

this application is meant to be a simple unzip, configure and run system. I may create some generator or compiler
to render the setup as easy as phpMyAdmin
